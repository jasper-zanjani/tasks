# General-purpose computer programming functional acts
Two main "layers" for programming tutorials

1. Structural concepts: objects, prototypes, methods, flow control, callback functions, etc
2. Syntax

output
  - print
    - error log
    - colors
  - file write
    disk with arrow point in

input
  - runtime user input
    - forms
    - text
    - modal and modeless dialogs
  - file read : disk with arrow pointing out

databases (object data + file read + file write)
  - connection
  - access
  - query
  - updating
  - creation
  - deletion
  
data types and type-specific operations
  - string
    - concatenation
  - number
    - math
  - array
    - append
    - delete
    - prepend
  - object
  - bool
    - logical operators
  - bitwise operations

control flow
  - loop
    - while
      - do-while
    - for
      - for-each / for-in
  - if conditional
    - else
    - elif

subroutine abstraction
  - functions
  - module or package import

expression examples
- print output + string data type = Hello World
- file read + subroutine abstraction
- modal and modeless dialog boxes = runtime user input + output
