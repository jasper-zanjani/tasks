# Task-based understanding of computer programming
As a former linguist trying to break into development, I am trying to leverage my knowledge of foreign language instruction and pedagagy to the project of learning how to code. This repo is my attempt to consolidate and organize my thoughts and observations on my proposed task-based curriculum of programming based on computer programming functional acts.

## Background

### Task-based instruction
The phrase "task-based" refers to the recent movement in foreign language instruction to move away from the traditional focus on grammar which has been termed, pejoratively, "form-based". This trend has gained currency over time as a more effective way to teach language as it is actually used and (especially) spoken, rather than a theoretical exercise.

### Functional acts in languages
Functional acts in language have a comparatively recent history in language studies, dating back to the Speech Acts proposed by [J.L. Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._L._Austin), collected in the volume _How to do Things with Words_. Austin identified five **speech acts**.

[John R. Searle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Searle) responded to and elaborated on Austin's work by identifying **twelve dimensions of variation** to distinguish "illocutionary" acts.

Scholarly work on this topic ultimately culminated in the [ISO 24617-2](https://www.iso.org/standard/51967.html) semantic annotation framework.

The long and the short of it is that annotating dialog acts has a substantial theoretical underpinning backed by decades of scholarly work, but despite this effort the work of identifying functional acts in spoken language remains only loosely standardized. Identifying dialog acts is "opt-in", in today's words.

## Applying language principles to computer programming
The focus on syntax that is universal to all coding tutorials available online is a symptom of the "form-based" way of thinking. The administrators of these online courses envision their mission as giving the learner the basic building blocks which ostensibly form the ingredients from which the recipes of the professionals (equivalent to native speakers) must ultimately derive. 

This is analogous to the approach of the traditional, form-based foreign language instructor who focuses on the grammatical constructions into which all of a speaker's utterances may be decomposed. There are comparatively few courses that adopt a task-based approach, with the notable exception of those that focus on projects and market themselves toward intermediate or advanced learners.

Two main "layers" for programming tutorials

1. Structural concepts: objects, prototypes, methods, flow control, callback functions, etc
2. Syntax

output
  - print
    - error log
    - colors
  - file write
    disk with arrow point in

input
  - runtime user input
    - forms
    - text
    - modal and modeless dialogs
  - file read : disk with arrow pointing out

databases (object data + file read + file write)
  - connection
  - access
  - query
  - updating
  - creation
  - deletion
  
data types and type-specific operations
  - string
    - concatenation
  - number
    - math
  - array
    - append
    - delete
    - prepend
  - object
  - bool
    - logical operators
  - bitwise operations

control flow
  - loop
    - while
      - do-while
    - for
      - for-each / for-in
  - if conditional
    - else
    - elif

subroutine abstraction
  - functions
  - module or package import

expression examples
- print output + string data type = Hello World
- file read + subroutine abstraction
- modal and modeless dialog boxes = runtime user input + output
